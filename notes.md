# .Net Deliverable 2 Assignment 2

## Notes

## Task: Counting Heads or Tails
- Write a console app that takes in a word (“heads” or “tails”) and number from the user.
- The number will represent how many coin flips the program outputs.
- Repeat coin flips based on the number of flips entered by the user (use the numberOfFlips​ variable). Each time:
-- Output the result of each coin flip on its own line,
 -- Followed by:
        -the number
        -percentage of total correct guesses

## Varibles
- headsOrTailsGuess - string - input from user 
- numberOfFlips - int - Repeat coin flips based on the number of flips entered by the user - 
- correctCount - int -
- percentage - double - 

## Class
- Random Class
--  Use the R​andom ​class to generate a new number each time.


## User steps
1. users sees "Guess which will have more: heads or tails?"
2. user inputs string "heads"
3. user sees "how many times shall we flip a coin?"
4. user inputs the number 5
5. user sees head or tails 5 times on separate lines 
6. user sees "your guess, ${headsOrTailsGuess}, came up ${correctCount} times."
7. ueser sees "That's ${percentCorrect}'"
